## Risks & Challenges.

| Risk                                          | Mitigation                                                   |
| --------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Bugs in dependencies                          | Consult with JavaScript expert if upstream doesn't fix it.   |
| Features insufficient to woo paying customers | Seek early feedback. Offer road-map, pitch crowd-funding those features |
| Whales (FB, MSFT, ...) copying features       | Superior customer support & training, closer partnership with rivals of said whales. |
|                                               |                                                              |
